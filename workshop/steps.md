# Target audience
> All those who want to easily get started, and become professional in Data Science (e.g., students, new grads).

# Requirements:
> Participants must bring their own laptops.

# Objective
Help participants in the following topics:
- What are the essential tools used by professional Data Scientists.
- How to setup those tools.
- How to use those tools effectively.
- Some good coding habits.

# Agenda
- Part I, 2 hours:
    * setup essential tools (Visual Studio Code, Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook, Virtual Environment, Git, GitHub).
    * how to use Visual Studio Code and Jupyter effectively.
    * some good coding habits.
- Part II, 2 hours:
    * how to use git effectively.

# Steps

- Brief self-introduction via [LinkIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaitaoyang/).

- Check how many tools that participants already have.
> Visual Studio Code, Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook, Virtual Environment, Git, GitHub
- Download and install tools:

        Windows: Right click "Windows Start" -> Click "System" -> You will see "System Type".

        macOS: Click "About This Mac" -> Click "More Info" -> In the Contents pane, click "Software" -> you will see "64-bit Kernel and Extensions".

        Linux: Press "Windows key" -> Type in "info" -> Click on "details".
    * Visual Studio Code {[Windows](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows), [macOS](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac), [Linux](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux)}
    * [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
    * [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
    * You do not need to install `Jupyter Notebook` and `Virtual Environment`, they will come automatically with Anaconda.
    * You only need to register a [GitHub account](https://github.com/) (you do not need to install GitHub desktop).

- Create an virtual environment.

- Generate SSH keys.

- Setup SSH keys on your GitHub account.
