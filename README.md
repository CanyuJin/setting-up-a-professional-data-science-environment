## Essential tools used by professional Data Scientists
> Visual Studio Code, Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook, Virtual Environment, Git, GitHub

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs) a free open-source and lightweight **code editor** from Microsoft, which is very popular among developers. Alternatives: IntelliJ, PyCharm, Spyder, etc. 

[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) is the world's most popular **data science platform**, which greatly simplifies package management.

[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) is a **web-based interactive computational environment** for creating Jupyter notebook documents. Alternatives: Jupyter Lab, Google Colab, Databricks Notebook.

[Virtual Environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#:~:text=A%20virtual%20environment%20is%20a,part%20of%20your%20operating%20system.) is a tool for creating different virtual environments for different projects (because different projects may have different requirements for Python packages). 

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a free and open source distributed **version control system**, tech teams must use it for collaborative working.

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is an online platform which provides hosting for software development and version control using Git. Alternatives: Bickbucket
